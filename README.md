## ðŸ‘‹ Hello world!

My name is **Aryan Thakar**, and Iâ€™m a **junior at the University of Maryland**.

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work in software development, AI bias research, and experiential marketing. I love exploring the intersection between technology and the human experience.

One question that continually drives me is:  
> *"How can I utilize computer science to help create positive experiences that have a lasting social impact?"*
